# POC 1 : MobX & React & Sockets
This second **P**roof **O**f **C**oncept aims to try the [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) library, and try to use Brume design system in it (you can see the concept idea in the front page)

## Commands
The front is using vite so `yarn dev` do the trick. The back is using nest so use `yarn start:dev`. Dont forget to `yarn` in the folders.

## Bulletpoint to validate
 - [x] Creating a Node is easy
 - [x] Background tiles
 - [ ] Edge linking (may need more work)
